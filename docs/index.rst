Welcome to CryptoBot Python's documentation!
==============================================

CryptoBot Python is an unofficial, but friendly Python client library for the `Crypto Bot <https://pay.crypt.bot/>`_ API.
It provides Pythonic models, sane defaults, and synchronous helpers so you can issue invoices or payouts with minimal boilerplate.

Features
--------

* **Lean synchronous client** powered by ``httpx``
* **Dataclass models** for invoices, balances, currencies, and exchange rates
* **Enum-based guard rails** for assets, statuses, and button names
* **Optional testnet support** and configurable request timeout
* **FastAPI webhook example** to bootstrap integrations
* **Comprehensive error handling** with custom exception classes

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from cryptobot import CryptoBotClient
   from cryptobot.models import Asset

   client = CryptoBotClient("YOUR_API_TOKEN")

   invoice = client.create_invoice(
       asset=Asset.USDT,
       amount=5.25,
       description="Coffee order #42",
   )

   print(invoice.bot_invoice_url)
